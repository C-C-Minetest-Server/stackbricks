# Stacked Bricks

Stacked bricks! This mod supports bricks from the [Minetest Game](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/), [Technic](https://content.luanti.org/packages/mt-mods/technic_plus/), [Moreblocks](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Calinou/moreblocks/), and [Ethereal NG](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/ethereal/). Mods may register their own using `stackbricks.register_stackbrick`.

Stacked bricks are crafted by putting a brick onto another brick in the crafting grid, or by putting their slabs like so. Slabs registered in Minetest Game and Stairsplus (bundled with Moreblocks) are supported.
